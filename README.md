<h1 align="center"> Python For Finance </h1>

## Overview
The financial industry is increasingly adopting Python for general purpose programming and quantitative analysis, ranging from
understanding trading dynamics to risk management systems.
This course focuses specifically on introducing Python for financial
analysis. Using practical examples, you will learn the fundamentals
of Python data structures such as lists and arrays and learn
powerful ways to store and manipulate financial data to identify
trends.

## INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of the course, you can achieve the following using python:
- Understand the various data structures in Python
-  Become familiar with the programming language and the
system of modules and tools 
- Get to grips with the various applications of Python â€“ graphs,
mathematical tools
- Write a good and fast Python code
- Be introduced to the machine learning library (scikit-learn) of
Python.

## Session Overview
For this bootcamp we will go through many topics in python language from zero to hero.
Each day we will have a mini-courses and assignments for applying what you learn, also we work on some mini projects in each of which you will use your gained skills to solve them at the end you will have a final project which is a real project that you may face durin you work in the industry.
