    "A support vector machine is a machine learning model that is able to generalise between two different classes if the set of labelled data is provided in the training set to the algorithm. The main function of the SVM is to check for that hyperplane that is able to distinguish between the two classes.\n",

    "There can be many hyperplanes that can do this task but the objective is to find that hyperplane that has the highest margin that means maximum distances between the two classes, so that in future if a new data point comes that is two be classified then it can be classified easily. "

Kernel tricks help in projecting data points to the higher dimensional space by which they became relatively more easily separable in higher-dimensional space.\n",
