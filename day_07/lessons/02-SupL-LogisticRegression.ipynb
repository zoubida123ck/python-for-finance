    "When data scientists may come across a new classification problem, the first algorithm that may come across their mind is **Logistic Regression**. It is a supervised learning classification algorithm which is used to predict observations to a discrete set of classes. Practically, it is used to classify observations into different categories. Hence, its output is discrete in nature. **Logistic Regression** is also called **Logit Regression**. It is one of the most simple, straightforward and versatile classification algorithms which is used to solve classification problems."

It means that given a set of observations, Logistic Regression algorithm helps us to classify these observations into two or more discrete classes. So, the target variable is discrete in nature.\n",

    "#### **Implement linear equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression algorithm works by implementing a linear equation with independent or explanatory variables to predict a response value. For example, we consider the example of number of hours studied and probability of passing the exam. Here, number of hours studied is the explanatory variable and it is denoted by x1. Probability of passing the exam is the response or target variable and it is denoted by z.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have one explanatory variable (x1) and one response variable (z), then the linear equation would be given mathematically with the following equation-\n",

Above this threshold value, we will map the probability values into class 1 and below which we will map values into class 0.\n",
