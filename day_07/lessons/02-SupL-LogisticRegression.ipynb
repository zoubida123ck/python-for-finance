    "### What is Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression is a statistical method that is used for building machine learning models where the dependent variable is dichotomous: i.e. binary. Logistic regression is used to describe data and the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The independent variables can be nominal, ordinal, or of interval type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The name \"logistic regression\" is derived from the concept of the logistic function that it uses. The logistic function is also known as the sigmoid function. The value of this logistic function lies between zero and one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The following is an example of a logistic function we can use to find the probability of a vehicle breaking down, depending on how many years it has been since it was serviced last.\n",
    "\n",
    "![example](../data/years.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here is how you can interpret the results from the graph to decide whether the vehicle will break down or not.\n",

    "### Advantages of the Logistic Regression Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression performs better when the data is linearly separable\n",
    "\n",
    "-    It does not require too many computational resources as it’s highly interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "-    There is no problem scaling the input features—It does not require tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "-    It is easy to implement and train a model using logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "-    It gives a measure of how relevant a predictor (coefficient size) is, and its direction of association (positive or negative)\n"

    "- Consider the following example: An organization wants to determine an employee’s salary increase based on their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this purpose, a linear regression algorithm will help them decide. Plotting a regression line by considering the employee’s performance as the independent variable, and the salary increase as the dependent variable will make their task easier.\n",
